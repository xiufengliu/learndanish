# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Danish Tutor application with advanced learning features, improved error handling, accessibility improvements, and user experience enhancements. The goal is to transform the current voice-based conversation app into a comprehensive language learning platform with vocabulary tracking, spaced repetition, customizable settings, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vocabulary Tracking System

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want the app to track vocabulary words I've encountered and practiced, so that I can monitor my learning progress and review words I need to practice more.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI tutor introduces a new Danish word in conversation THEN the system SHALL extract and store the word with its English translation, context, and timestamp
2. WHEN a previously learned word appears in conversation THEN the system SHALL increment its practice count and update the last practiced timestamp
3. WHEN the user views their vocabulary list THEN the system SHALL display all tracked words with their translations, practice counts, and proficiency levels
4. IF a word has been practiced multiple times successfully THEN the system SHALL mark it as "mastered" with a visual indicator
5. WHEN vocabulary data is stored THEN the system SHALL persist it in localStorage with proper error handling for storage limits

### Requirement 2: Vocabulary Flashcard System

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to review vocabulary from my conversations using flashcards, so that I can reinforce my learning through active recall.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the flashcard mode THEN the system SHALL display vocabulary words extracted from conversations in a flashcard interface
2. WHEN a flashcard is shown THEN the system SHALL display the Danish word on the front and the English translation with context on the back
3. WHEN the user marks a flashcard as "easy", "medium", or "hard" THEN the system SHALL adjust the word's review schedule using spaced repetition algorithm
4. WHEN the user completes a flashcard session THEN the system SHALL show statistics including words reviewed, accuracy rate, and next review date
5. IF no vocabulary words exist THEN the system SHALL display a message encouraging the user to have conversations first

### Requirement 3: Grammar Correction Highlights

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to see grammar corrections highlighted in my chat messages, so that I can learn from my mistakes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message with grammatical errors THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight the errors with visual indicators
2. WHEN the user hovers over or taps a grammar correction THEN the system SHALL display an explanation of the error and the correct form
3. WHEN grammar corrections are provided THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (verb conjugation, word order, article usage, etc.)
4. WHEN the AI tutor provides corrections THEN the system SHALL store them for later review in a corrections history
5. IF the user's message is grammatically correct THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback without highlighting

### Requirement 4: Topic-Based Conversation Modes

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to practice conversations on specific topics like ordering food or asking for directions, so that I can prepare for real-world situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses conversation modes THEN the system SHALL display a list of available topics (ordering food, directions, shopping, greetings, travel, etc.)
2. WHEN the user selects a topic THEN the system SHALL update the AI tutor's system instruction to focus on that specific scenario
3. WHEN a topic-based conversation is active THEN the system SHALL display the current topic prominently in the UI
4. WHEN the user wants to switch topics THEN the system SHALL allow changing the conversation mode without losing chat history
5. WHEN a topic is completed THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of vocabulary and phrases learned in that context

### Requirement 5: Spaced Repetition System

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want vocabulary to be reviewed at optimal intervals based on my performance, so that I can efficiently retain what I've learned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vocabulary word is first learned THEN the system SHALL schedule it for review using the SM-2 or similar spaced repetition algorithm
2. WHEN the user correctly recalls a word THEN the system SHALL increase the interval before the next review
3. WHEN the user struggles with a word THEN the system SHALL decrease the interval and schedule more frequent reviews
4. WHEN vocabulary is due for review THEN the system SHALL display a notification or badge indicating the number of words to review
5. WHEN the user completes reviews THEN the system SHALL update the review schedule for each word based on performance

### Requirement 6: Error Boundary Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to gracefully handle errors without crashing completely, so that I can continue using the app even when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JavaScript error occurs in any component THEN the error boundary SHALL catch it and prevent the entire app from crashing
2. WHEN an error is caught THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with recovery options
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details to the console for debugging purposes
4. WHEN the user clicks a recovery option THEN the system SHALL attempt to reset the affected component or provide a way to continue
5. IF critical errors occur repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide an option to clear all data and reset the app

### Requirement 7: API Retry Logic

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically retry failed API calls, so that temporary network issues don't disrupt my learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails due to network error THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a retry is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with retry attempt information
3. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with a manual retry button
4. WHEN the Gemini API returns a rate limit error THEN the system SHALL wait the appropriate time before retrying
5. WHEN connection is restored after failure THEN the system SHALL automatically resume the session without user intervention

### Requirement 8: Audio Quality Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see indicators of audio quality and connection status, so that I know when technical issues might affect my conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the microphone is active THEN the system SHALL display a real-time audio level indicator showing input volume
2. WHEN the connection quality degrades THEN the system SHALL display a warning indicator with connection status
3. WHEN audio is being processed THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback indicating the system is listening or speaking
